Who:
NER may not work for some names of people, but ultimately works better than other processors that only can point out proper nouns
(for "who" we want a person)
Only want a proper noun person for a "good" question 
-only takes in sentences with proper noun person
(can't answer with "her" for a question) 
________________
Verb [VP] formats:
verb_tenses
verb_tenses + [something] ([VP], [NP], etc)
________________
Limitations:
Does not ask questions about sentences with person in verb phrase
- "The best person is Lauren" 
But avoid issues like:
-"He is Lauren's best friend." -> Who is Lauren's best friend?
NER may not recognize name of person as name, or may classify something that is not a name
as a name
Grammar limitations: "The Johnsons like to swim" -> "Who like to swim?"
Supposed to be "Who likes to swim?" (present tense supposed to have singular verb form)
____________
Sentence formats: simple predicate ([NP] + [VP])
-only makes a question when nsubj is proper noun person
-avoids sentences like: Lauren's house is just around the block.
Question format: Who + singular form of [VP] (past and present)
-done by taking all children of [VP] and making sure it's in singular form
Covers verb + infinitive (want to ___, likes to ___)
Covers modal verbs (would ___, could ___, could have ___) -> [MD] + [VP]

When:
Entities to look for:
-DATE
-EVENT
-TIME

Sentence format:
Form 1: ([PP] with DATE) + [NP] + [VP]
Form 2: [NP] + [VP] (with ([PP] with DATE) at end)
_________
Question format:
When did/does/do [NP] + [VP] (w/o [PP] with DATE if Form 2, lemma form of verb)
-VBD => did
-VBP => do
-VBZ => does
_________
We only consider dates within a [PP] because:
-something like "60 years" is classified as date -> could be age ("He is 60 years old.")
_________
Limitations:
Limited to sentences with format above, only when nsubj of sentence is a proper noun
For a sentence with both forms, the question will ask about the date in the first [PP]

Where:
Entities to look for:
-GPE, LOC, FAC
Same structure as "When"

get_children grammar limitations:
-sometimes "3-0" becomes "3- 0"
